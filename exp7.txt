Title: Snort IDS Installation & Testing (Ubuntu)

INSTALL
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y snort

1) Set HOME_NET in snort.conf
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
# Find and set:
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.96.0/24

2) Ensure rule paths and include local.rules
# in snort.conf
var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules

3) Create an ICMP detection rule
echo 'alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP test"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)' | sudo tee /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

4) Validate configuration
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

5) Run Snort in console IDS mode
sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

6) Generate test traffic (from a separate VM)
ping <your_host_ip_in_HOME_NET>

7) Observe alerts in console and logs in /var/log/snort

EXTENSION: Add a TCP rule for port 80
echo 'alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"TCP 80"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)' | sudo tee -a /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
# Restart snort and trigger with nmap -p80 <your_host>

TROUBLESHOOT
- If Snort doesnâ€™t start, run the -T test to see syntax errors and missing rule files.
- Confirm HOME_NET is correct for your lab network.
