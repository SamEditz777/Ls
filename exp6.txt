Title: DoS Traffic Simulation with hping3 (Ubuntu) — Low-rate, Lab-only

SAFETY NOTE
- DoS/DDoS is destructive and often illegal outside a controlled lab. Do not run floods against real targets.
- This guide demonstrates low-rate simulation only (no --flood examples provided).

INSTALL
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y hping3 tcpdump wireshark

1) Identify target VM IP
# On target: ip -br a
# On attacker: ping <target_ip>

2) Low-rate ICMP generation (visualize & monitor)
sudo hping3 -1 -i u10000 <target_ip>
# -1 = ICMP, -i u10000 = interval 10,000 microseconds (1 pkt / 10ms) — adjust safely

3) Low-rate SYN trickle (visualize TCP)
sudo hping3 -S -p 80 -i u20000 <target_ip>

4) Observe on target
sudo tcpdump -i any icmp
sudo tcpdump -i any tcp port 80

5) Discuss observable effects
- small spikes in packet rate; CPU / network counters slightly elevated
- real DoS signs: sustained high packet rates, packet loss, CPU exhaustion

DISALLOWED / OMITTED
- No instructions for high-rate flooding, amplification attacks, random-source spoofing, or anonymization.
